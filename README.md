Hi Farhan Khan this side.In this repository i'll upload python program with my own logic and some with the help of my mentor.<br>

Also i explain code in simple words so that everyone can understand.<br>


       - In the palindrome program we simply input a three digit number. (point to be noted that this program give output only for 3 digit)<br>
        
        num // 100 gives the first digit.
        num % 10 gives the last digit.

        if first and last digit is same then the number is palindrome otherwise it is not palindrome

        21/08/24 :- In the 2nd program, here i create a name check program. In this program, you type your name and if name is available<br> in the list it shows your name is present in the list. if you enter wrong name it shows your name is not in the list.
